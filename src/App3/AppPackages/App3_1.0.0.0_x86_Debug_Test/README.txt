The packages can be used only on a computer that has developer license installed or meets the requirements for sideloading Windows Store apps.

# Add-AppxDevPackage.ps1 is a PowerShell script designed to install app
# packages created by Visual Studio for developers.  To run this script from
# Explorer, right-click on its icon and choose "Run with PowerShell".
#
# Visual Studio supplies this script in the folder generated with its
# "Prepare Package" command.  The same folder will also contain the app
# package (a .appx file), the signing certificate (a .cer file), and a
# "Dependencies" subfolder containing all the framework packages used by the
# app.
#
# This script simplifies installing these packages by automating the
# following functions:
#   1. Find the app package and signing certificate in the script directory
#   2. Prompt the user to acquire a developer license and to install the
#      certificate if necessary
#   3. Find dependency packages that are applicable to the operating system's
#      CPU architecture
#   4. Install the package along with all applicable dependencies
#
# All command line parameters are reserved for use internally by the script.
# Users should launch this script from Explorer.
